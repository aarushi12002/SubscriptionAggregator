# SubscriptionAggregator
Problem: you subscribe to too many newsletters, RSS feeds, but that can get lost in your emails. One could categorize and add them to a folder but one still needs to go through each one of them which is ineffective. A collective one page summary of all topics from different newsletters can help you digest information in a more efficient manner. 

Vision:

- Effective ingestion of information- diverse topics, weekly digest

Components:

- Cron job
- Aggregator: aggregates feed from different newsletters
- Ability to add new RSS feeds/newsletters
- Summarizer: summarizes all the feeds with read more links
